 Why: to learn how to code
 - to learn autolayout
 - how to transfer data between VControllers
 - how to use searchbar

 What did you learn from this project
ðŸš™ vaguely, how to search through a matrix
 - ex: Series[Season[Episode, Episode],
                Season[Episode,Episode]]
 - to prepare for multiple segues given prototype cells
ðŸš™ How many subclasses of UITableViewCell - 1
 - checking for nil in segues, downcasting, searchbar
 - how to read many errors!!
 - how to use Property Observers (ex: willSet or didSet)

 How: to do this
 - let's create a tableview in a view controller
 - create two prototype cells
